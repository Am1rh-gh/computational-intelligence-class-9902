## Twitter Airline Sentiment Analysis
In this project we are trying to analyse sentiment of tweets about airlines  with Bert using Python and Pytorch.


We use this dataset to train, evaluate and test our algorithm
we import our dataset and using tokenizer we convert our input dataset to fit our model.
 training the tokens takes place with 15 epochs after the training is done   accuracy levels is about 85% 
this dataset has more negative sentiment than positive or nuetral so the accuracy level in negative sentiments is more accurate and about 90%
